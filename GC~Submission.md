Abstract: This blog takes a look into how the world is connected by fiber optic cables something most people don't know about.  It's made to explain the lengths and innovation humanity took to make the worlds countries accessible to one another. Showing where each cable starts from, the paths they take and where they end.

## Intro

Underwater fiber optic cables! There are so many and yet few people know about them, which is weird when it's the very thing that brings the internet around our world. So I decided to [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1iKWbHvLQHEoA3LHhRvxYPKgvtukw4X4&ll=13.622467592156205%2C0&z=2) ones that I thought 
were important, interesting, or had a cool shape!  ヽ(•‿•)ノ

To start with my map, I placed the tat-8 cable which was actually the first underwater optic cable. I did this to link a [timeline]([https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1iKWbHvLQHEoA3LHhRvxYPKgvtukw4X4&ll=13.622467592156205%2C0&z=2](https://gabbycole841.wixsite.com/phosgold/post/timeline-0)) that I made to 
my map, almost like I was networking (wink wink). Then I moved on to finding cables with importance, like AAE-1 which connects three continents (Africa, Asia, & Europe). 
After more searching I came to realize that not all cables would have major significance to them. So, I transitioned onto ones that had an 
interesting name to them (POSEIDON) or entertaining shape (SAM-1). It was amusing to find out about future cables to be 
built, and just how far they are expected to go. The “Far north fiber” and “Polar express” are set out to cover 29,650 km combine! 
(basically covering the top half of my map) The future of underwater fiber optic cables is expanding...

## What Surprised me

I was surprised at first to find out how many cables become decommissioned; logically it makes sense with the scale of the 
projects and amount it would cost, but I’d assume you’d want to finish something like that when you gain nothing but benefits in 
the end. Another surprise was that some cables become abandoned, some due to the harsh conditions under the water but for 
others where that's not the case, it takes about 25 years to stop working and they're just left in the sea. (poor turtles) I feel like a good future project someone could look into would be the recycling of these cables or maybe the refurbishings to not lose the materials used. Not surprising, but an “oh” moment was noticing 
how North Korea has no cables connected to it, which just demonstrates how isolated the citizens must be.

## What I Learned?

With the help of this assignment I learned that undersea cables are what really bring internet to the world, not satellites. 
They transmit 99% of international data and help with international trade, connecting advanced economies[^1]. Cables also 
cost a pretty penny, with trans-oceanic ones costing upward of $250-$400 million dollars! \(๑•́o•̀๑)/ 
The future for submarine cables also looks bright, as the growth of data and internet in the world leads to a need for new 
cables which in the end will help the global economy[^2]. Another fact was that when cables can no longer be used or 
repaired, they are then used for scientific research. So I guess some of the abandoned ones are repurposed.

## My Experience

Making the map was a fun experience, researching helped me to learn where the most common landing points for cables are and 
new places I didn’t even know existed! Through this exploration I came to have more appreciation for those that make maps, 
as I would have trouble getting the lines to bend how I want to avoid land, or when the line would discontinue, and I'd have 
to start over I'd get frustrated. It's a very time-consuming process if you’re going for a certain look, but in the end, I did enjoy seeing my 
map unfold into something bigger and the final product was something I am happy with. (⁀ᗢ⁀)

## Uniqueness

My map is unique because of the bias I put into it. I picked and researched the cables that made it onto the final map, along 
with placing every landing point and connecting them to lines making it actually look like the directions the cables go in 
under water. Though some cables were picked at random as I wanted to fill in space on the map to give more geographical 
context.

## Conclusion

Compared to the timeline assignment, I had to do more research for this one. Finding where each cable starts, stops and 
connects, while also having to be selective in which cables I chose. Where on the other hand I just had to pick which piece 
of information seemed more important in the grand scheme of things for the timeline. 

With the map I was trying to give geographical context to the extensive scale of underwater optic cables, and that even with 
how little I chose to display there is still global coverage. Meaning that with some envisioning seeing how interconnected 
the world is becomes eye opening. 

I think I preferred making the map more, the timeline was simple, and I felt like I was more hands on in the creation of 
this. I also learned more about fiber optic cables of the present and future instead of the past which is better as time only 
moves forward. 

I didn't include that many pictures because of copyright, but I think my map has enough imagery on it's own.

My biggest help was Submarine cable map, as it told me the landing points of each cable along with the general shape I should 
make my line in.
